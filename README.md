# Sweep
A simple Java program that organizes files in the current directory into categorized folders based on the file extensions.

## Features

 | Videos       | mp4, avi, mkv, mov, flv    |
 | Documents    | pdf, docx, txt, pptx, xlsx |
 | Others       | Anything else              |

 ## How to Run
